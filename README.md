# DDoS-Attack-Identification-Usin-Deep-Learning-Approach
In this project, I have created a Hybrid learning model by combining two individual models of Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU).
**OVERVIEW**
In today's digitally connected world, network infrastructures face escalating cyber threats, with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks posing a significant challenge. This project endeavors to fortify network security by leveraging the power of deep learning through a cutting-edge Hybrid Learning Model. Combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for temporal sequence analysis, this model aims to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks efficiently.
